# Speakers

#### [Mikeal Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikeal)

Mikeal is the Community Manager of the Node.js Foundation and the creator of 
[request](https://github.com/request/request) and [NodeConf](http://www.nodeconf.com).

His talk will be all about what the Foundation has been up to recently and its plans for 
the rest of 2016.

#### [Justin Meyer](https://twitter.com/justinbmeyer)

Justin Meyer (@justinbmeyer) is the lead author of DoneJS and a core contributor to CanJS 
and StealJS. He’s the CEO of Bitovi, a JavaScript consulting company known for making apps 
for Walmart and other high profile companies he can’t talk about.

His talk shows how the recently released DoneJS framework makes it easy to build fast 
single page applications that are:
* server side rendered
* progressively loaded
* use content delivery networks

You will discover how DoneJS solves these problems while building a simple real-time chat 
application. As a bonus, Justin will show how to build the chat application to a mobile and 
desktop application so all three versions of the app can chat together. If there's time, 
he might even turn on worker thread rendering.

#### [Andrew Hao](https://github.com/andrewhao)

Andrew is a software developer at Carbon Five, a software development and product consultancy 
in Santa Monica. As a trail runner, he loves finding new routes for long runs in the mountains.

Andrew is speaking about functional reactive programming and how it's the bee's knees. 
But... you can't figure out how it works, and all the math-talk and theory jargon that surround 
the subject are confusing to you.
 
Fear not! Together, we'll go through the concepts of streams, functions, and data flow. We'll 
take the concepts apart with diagrams and explain them in plain English.
 
With this newfound knowledge, we'll build ourselves a pedometer (step counter) with our new 
learnings and RxJS, a Javascript FRP library. We'll discuss how we can embed these things in 
real-world physical devices - like the Pebble smartwatch!
 
We'll even talk a little bit about how reactive programming concepts apply to real world 
frameworks like React, Redux, and Elm. In the end, you'll not only get up to speed about 
reactive programming, you'll be able to have new insights and tools to implement reactive 
principles in your next project.
