# Speakers

#### [Mikeal Rogers](https://twitter.com/mikeal)

Mikeal is the Community Manager of the Node.js Foundation and the creator of
[request](https://github.com/request/request) and [NodeConf](http://www.nodeconf.com).

His talk will be all about what the Foundation has been up to recently and its plans for
the rest of 2016.

#### [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams)

Ashley, npm's Developer Community and Content Manager, gives a quick tour of npm’s greatest
features, old and new, and demonstrates how they can be integrated into your workflow to make
you better, happier, and more productive. Ashley will outline the most commonly used npm tools
for starting a project, managing a project through development, test, and deployment, and
managing teams and organization project work. She’ll focus in particular on workflows that
will help frontend developers, npm’s biggest and fastest-growing group of users.
